Like any other piece of software (and information generally), mess822
comes with NO WARRANTY.


Things you have to decide before starting:

* The mess822 home directory, normally /usr/local. To change this
directory, edit conf-home now.

* The qmail home directory, normally /var/qmail. new-inject and ofmipd
need to know where qmail is so that they can send mail. To change this
directory, edit conf-qmail now.


How to install:

 1. Compile the programs and create the formatted man pages:
       % make

 2. Install the programs and man pages:
       # make setup check


That's it! To report success:
       % ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) | mail djb-qst@cr.yp.to
Replace First M. Last with your name.
